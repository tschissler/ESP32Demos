# ESP32 Demos
This is a repository with some very basic demos for the ESP 32 microcontroller (http://esp32.net/)

The demos are created by using the D1 R32 development board (https://www.az-delivery.de/products/esp32-d1-r32-board?_pos=2&_sid=156b54a0b&_ss=r). 
For coding Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and PlatformIO (https://platformio.org/) have been used. 
But the code samples should easily work with other boards / IDEs.
